# A word from the developer

Dear friends,

Thank you for taking a moment to consider supporting Audibible. This application is much more than just a technology project: it's a mission, a way of making God's Word accessible to everyone, anytime, anywhere. From the outset, our team has worked passionately to create an audio experience that inspires, guides and connects everyone to an inexhaustible spiritual source.

Your financial support plays an essential role. It enables us not only to constantly improve the application by adding features and optimizing performance, but also to go further. We dream of adding new voices to offer diversity that touches even more hearts, producing podcasts that explore spiritual and practical topics, and creating audio meditations that accompany your daily life. Every donation brings us closer to these goals.

We believe deeply that this project can transform lives, and we're honored that you'd consider being part of this adventure. Together, we can build something lasting, a platform that spreads a message of hope, faith and love around the world.

Thank you so much for your support. Your support is not just an encouragement, it's a blessing.

<br />
<br />
Best regards, St√©phane.
