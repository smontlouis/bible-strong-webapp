# A word from the developer



Dear users and friends,
I'm grateful for every moment you spend with the Bible Strong application, a tool designed to enrich your Bible studies. 

Initially, I developed this application to meet a personal need related to the lack of adequate tools at the time. I'm delighted to see that thousands of people around the world now use Bible Strong on a daily basis!

To continue to offer and improve this experience, I need your support.

## Your support makes a difference

Every donation helps to maintain the servers and develop new features. Your generosity has already enabled tangible improvements, such as the ability to store and download Bibles offline, improving the experience for all our users, especially those in countries where internet connection can be difficult.

## Bible Strong is, and will remain, free

I am deeply convinced that access to God's Word should be a universal right, without financial barriers. That's the spirit in which Bible Strong was created, and I'm committed to upholding that ideal. 

This policy ensures that everyone, regardless of their economic situation, can immerse themselves in biblical teachings and grow spiritually. By removing financial barriers, we open the door to a wider and more diverse community, uniting people in their quest for spiritual knowledge and understanding.

Bible Strong isn't just an app; it's a commitment to accessibility and equality in the study of the Word.

## How can you help?

As I'm working alone on this project, I have to manage considerable monthly operating costs. 
Your help, whether one-time or regular, will enable me to cover these costs and continue the mission.

To express my gratitude, I will mention the names of donors in a special section of the application and on the website (with your permission).

Giving is easy. You'll find a variety of payment methods to facilitate your contribution.

Your help is essential now more than ever. Together, we can continue to bring the Word of God into the lives of thousands.

If you cannot contribute financially, consider sharing Bible Strong with your community or offering a little of your time as a volunteer on [the repo github] (https://github.com/smontlouis/bible-strong).

<br/><br/><br/>
With gratitude,<br/>
St√©phane.
